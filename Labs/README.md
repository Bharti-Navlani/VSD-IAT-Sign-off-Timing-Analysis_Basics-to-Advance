## Lab_1 : **About OpenSTA**

        
OpenSTA is a gate level static timing verifier. As a stand-alone executable it can be used to verify the timing of a design using standard file formats like :- 

-Verilog netlist    
-Liberty library    
-SDC timing constraints    
-SDF delay annotation    
-SPEF parasitics
    
OpenSTA is architected to be easily bolted on to other tools as a timing engine. 

By using a network adapter, OpenSTAcan access the host netlist data structures without duplicating them. 

Query based incremental update of delays, arrival and required times & Simulator to propagate constants from constraints and netlist tie high/low

## Lab_4 : Clock Gating Check

STA tool enable stable w.r.t clock in setup & hold time window 

Following is the input taken to perform the experiment :-

## Lab 4 : Async Pin Check 

For Async pin , asserting has no relation with the clock but dessertion caused flop to be dependent on clock which can lead to unknow states hence STA tool perform such checks while doing the timing analysis & these are known as recovery & removal timing checks

## Lab_5 : Common Path Pessimism Removal(CPPR) 

Many a time your chip is overdesigned due to undue pessimism in timing calculations. Pessimism in timing analysis makes it difficult for designs to close timing and it is imperative that analysis is not overly pessimistic. There is a clock path related pessimism observed in timing calculated in on-chip-variation mode, and EDA tools have the capability to automatically remove the pessimism while analysis


Following the verilog code & schematic of the design used for analysis for CPPR :-

## Lab_5 : ECO Engineering Change Order

•In the ECO cycle, we perform various analysis one by one for every check which we need to close but not closed till PnRstage. 

•There are specialized signoff tools that help us to analyze the issue and also suggest the changes we need to do in order to close the issue. 

•The suggested change is captured in an eco file.

•In this lab we will focus on ECO for timing purposes, this is done to fix setup and hold violations
